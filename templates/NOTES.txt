Hytale Server has been deployed!

{{- if eq .Values.service.type "LoadBalancer" }}
Service Type: LoadBalancer
External IP: {{ .Values.service.port }}
{{- else }}
Service Type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
Port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
{{- end }}

BEFORE you can connect to this server from your Hytale client you NEED to authenticate the server!
To do so you need to attach to the server:

kubectl attach -it -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

Then run the following command and follow its instructions:

/auth login device

Now you should be able to connect.

This container & chart has an auto-update feature implemented.
Upon restarting it'll check what the latest version is and if an update is found, it'll overwrite the server files.
ALL OTHER files will remain untouched!

Have fun! :)
