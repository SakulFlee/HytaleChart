Hytale Server has been deployed!
However, this does not mean it is usable yet.
There is manual work required!

First, the Hytale downloader needs to be authorized.
Check the container logs and follow the instructions:
kubectl logs -f -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

After authorization, the latest server files will be downloaded and prepared.
This may take a few minutes based on your internet connection.

Eventually, the Hytale server should start.
Once again, it has to be authorized first.
Exit the logs (CTRL+C) and attach to the container instead:
kubectl attach -it -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

You should have full access to the Hytale server console now.
In the console enter and follow the instructions:
auth login device

Your server should be running and authenticated now.
However, this is only a temporary authentication!
To make this permanent enter:
auth persistence Encrypted

Now, your server should be authenticated even after restarting the container.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The server will AUTOMATICALLY update upon RESTARTING the container!
Usually, there should be no issue with this as ONLY the server files (not save game, "Universe", mods, configs, or anything else) will be overwritten.
However, mods MAY BREAK after updates!
